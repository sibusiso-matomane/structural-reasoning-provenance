# Reasoning Provenance Engine

Open-source structural diagnostic engine designed to detect divergence between model outputs and real-world constraints through reasoning provenance tracking.

The system treats reasoning as structured, inspectable data rather than opaque AI generation. It enables traceable analysis, structural validation, and early detection of instability across AI systems, markets, and complex decision environments.

## Architectural Premise

Modern AI systems produce outputs without exposing reasoning structure. This project separates generation from reasoning inspection by recording provenance as structured state.

Reasoning becomes:

- traceable
- inspectable
- auditable
- structurally testable

---

## Core Idea

Instead of evaluating only outputs, the engine tracks reasoning pathways, allowing:

- failure surface detection
- model–reality divergence analysis
- structural consistency validation
- inspection-first diagnostics

---

## Design Principles

- Separation of generation and reasoning inspection
- Reasoning as data, not narrative
- Structural diagnostics over output scoring
- Auditability by default
